<h1>My view regarding the delivery of valuable software</h1>

<h2>The goal</h2>

<p>Some time ago, a new work mate arrived to the office. He taught me a new concept called "DevOps". I had never heard about it before. At the beginning I though it was just another tool or methodology but nothing else. I soon realized DevOps has a great potential when I realized that it aims to close a development virtuous cycle and to get more frequently feedbacks. It fosters various team to work together. As a Developer/Operational guy I definitively have to consider it!!</p>

<p>A new world of new terms, concepts was unveiling in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>I want to expose the main ideas and some tools that I have gathered along my learning process.</p>

<p>I like to think about all of these concepts starting from a key principle in the agile movement:<br>
	<i> Our highest priority is to <b>satisfy the customer</b> through <b>early and continuous</b> delivery of <b>valuable</b> software.<br>
    <b>Agile Manifesto</b>
    </i>
</p>

<p>Despite it may seem to be all about software development it goes beyond. Where the software runs?(Ops team) Who knows the business case/user valuable think that the software has to cover?(business team)...</p>

<p>This broad principle encompasses development, operational and business teams among other teams as well.</p>

<h2>The pipeline</h2>

<p>OK, I already have a principle, a goal to work towards. How do I accomplish this in practice?</p>

<p>I've seen that the community uses a common pipeline diagram:</p>
<img src="images/pipeline.png"/ ><br>

<i>Image source: <a href="https://blog.pivotal.io">blog.pivotal.io</a></i>

<p>Of course, the important thing for me <b>is not the pipeline diagram in itself but the principle behind it</b>. The pipeline may change or could be seen in multiples ways but the principle prevails. I want to emphasize the <b>feedback loop</b> because without it the pipeline is not complete for me. But... what feedback has to be collected?</p>

<h2>The feedback loop</h2>

<p>To satisfy our customers we have to provide:</p>

    <i><b>early and continuous</b> delivery of <b>valuable</b> software</i>

<p>We have defined a pipeline to make early and continuous delivery possible (we will see tools later) but what about valuable software?</p>

<p>Now is where I think that business team comes into the scene! How do we measure valuable software? It will depend on the business model. If the product that the customer requests is a mobile application the downloads count could be the right metric for the feedback loop:</p>

<ul>
	<li>more downloads --> more valuable software</li>
	<li>more users --> more valuable software</li>
	<li>more subscriptions --> more valuable software</li>
	<li>more renewals --> more valuable software</li>
	<li>.......</li>
</ul>

<p>And the feedback loop could be a combination of metrics.</p>

<p>Eric Viles wrote on his book <b>Lean startup</b> about these metric and he alerts you about the consequences of taking bad metrics: <b>vanity metrics & action metrics</b>. Take care about your feedback loop or you will be building a vicious cycle that leads to the agile bankruptcy!</p>

<p><b>Dedicated to</b>: the new work mate that arrived to the office and allowed me to start this travel.</p>

<h2>The tools</h2>

(in progress)

<p>I'll complete it with tools that have its place on the pipeline diagram above:</p>

<ul>
<li> Coding tools:
	<ul>
	    <li> Atom </li>
	    <li> Eclipse </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> Version control tools:
	<ul>
    	<li> GIT </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> Build:
	<ul>
    	<li> Maven </li>
    	<li> Gradle </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> Test/Verify:
	<ul>
    	<li> XUnit : JUnit, Qunit, etc. </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> Package Repository:
</li>
<li> Infrastructure Platform:
</li>
<li>Production Concerns (Monitoring, etc.):
</li>
